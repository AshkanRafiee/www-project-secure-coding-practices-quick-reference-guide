## Welcome to the Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide Project

The Secure Coding Practices Quick Reference Guide is a technology agnostic set
of general software security coding practices, in a comprehensive checklist
format, that can be integrated into the development life-cycle. At only 17 pages
long, it is easy to read and digest.

The focus is on secure coding requirements, rather then on vulnerabilities and
exploits. It includes an introduction to Software Security Principles and a
glossary of key terms.

It is designed to serve as a secure coding kick-start tool and easy reference,
to help development teams quickly understand secure coding practices.

## Sections of the Guide

* Table of contents
* Introduction
* Software Security Principles Overview
* Secure Coding Practices Checklist
* Links to useful resources
* Glossary of important terminology
