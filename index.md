## Cornucopia

Here is the [version 2.1][en21pdf] of the Secure Coding Practices quick reference guide
that has the numbering system used in the [Cornucopia project][cornucopia] playing cards.

### Archived project

The OWASP Secure Coding Practices Quick-reference Guide project has now been archived.

The content of the Secure Coding Practices Quick-reference Guide overview and glossary has been migrated
to various sections within the [OWASP Developer Guide][owaspdevguide].

The Secure Coding Practices Quick-reference Guide checklists have also been migrated to the Developer Guide;
this provides a wider audience for the original checklist.

Contact [Jon Gadsden][jon] for any questions about this move.
